# + MC_Outgoing     - class for all outgoing packets
#    + MC_Advert_Outgoing   - advert to send
#    + MC_SrcDest_Out       - outgoing message with source and destination (don't use this class directly)

#
# To create an outbound packet (ie, to send), create an instance of the desired class. Each class
# constructor's parameters are slightly different, which reflects what the class is for an how it's
# used. For example, MC_Text_Out requires a source and destination, while MC_GroupText_Out only
# needs a channel to send to.
#
# Inbound packets are created by calling the appropriate class with the packet data and any other parameters
# needed to construct the packet. For instance, MC_Advert requires the packet data, while MC_Text also needs
# the client's identity and known contacts, so it can decode the message.
#
# A class method in MC_Inbound takes care of identifying the packet type and calling the correct class
# constructor
#
# An MC_Inbound packet can be sent to the dispatcher the same way as an MC_Outbound packet; this is used
# for repeaters
